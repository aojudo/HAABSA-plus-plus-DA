the decor is night tho ... but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this $T$ look sleek and modern .

i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a $T$ intimidate me , i.e . make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
